## How the script works

This script executes the following steps:

1. load the data sets of train and test;
2. merges the two data sets;
3. load the data set of the feature's names;
4. filter only the feature's names which represents mean and standard deviation;
5. filter the columns of the data set built on step 2 to get only the features selected on the previous step;
6. assess the mean of the variables;
7. put the name of the variables on the columns;
8. write a .txt file.

## Description of the variables

The variables represent the mean and the standard deviation of the variables in the data sets of train and test.
Moreover, after selected those variables, it was assessed the mean of the variables.
